    <a href="https://www.challenge.media"><h3>Challenge Media</h3></a>
    <p>Founded: 2016</br>
    Motto: "Challenge Everything."</p>
    <p>Challenge Media is a new media company made for a new age.<br><br/>
    What began as a loose collective posting art wherever there was a submit/post button, Challenge Media finally went legitimate and was organized into a network of creatives working on our own publications. Though it was officially formed in the late summer of 2016, if you've been on the internet the last 20 years, it's likely you've seen some of our work.<br><br/>
    If you'd like to join our network, send a message to <a href="mailto:info@challenge.media">info@challenge.media</a> to introduce yourself. We'll get back to you as soon as we're able.<br></br> 
    <hr>
    In addition to our own publications, Challenge Media provides creative strategy consulting to businesses of any size. From the small, family-owned, mom-and-pop shop to the large, multinational corporation competing in the global marketplace, we encourage you to reach out and see how we can help your organization.<br></br>
    Challenge Media is a unique startup that is uncompromising in its belief in creative and editorial independence. The company refuses to cater to outside shareholder investment or change course based on the whims of venture capital. The company refuses to rely on donations or apply for federal and/or non-governmental organizational grants. While we do work with advertisers, annual budgetary decisions are made solely upon the input/output of completed work and our subscription base.<br><br/> 
    We do all this to protect our publications and our independence. Strictly operating this way allows our business to remain committed to our principles and it allows the greatest amount of freedom in thought and opinion.<br></br>
    <a href="https://www.walkercraig.com">Craig Walker</a> is the Founder and current President of Challenge Media.</p>
